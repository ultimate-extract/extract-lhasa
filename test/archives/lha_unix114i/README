subdir.lzh   - Archive containing subdirectories.
               This archive has specially chosen permissions - the file
               is contained in a directory without write permissions.
               The archive therefore has to be extracted carefully,
               with the directory's contents extracted before the
               permissions on it are set.  The Unix LHA tool, although
               it was used to create this archive, fails to extract it.
